1 /48mz(1 tick) = 0.02us; so 1 second = 1/0.02us, i.e (10^6)/0.02 = 50000000 ticks;

24 hrs = 24*3600 seconds; 24hrs = 24*3600*500000000 = 4320000000000 ticks; 

this 4320000000000 can be represented in 42 bit variable. we have 32 bits in timers; remaining 10 bits need another 16bit variable.

So everytime 32 bit timers overflow add 1 to that 16 bit variable.
